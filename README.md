Radiative-Convective Equilibrium

The goal here will be to use the "master" branch to have the base case
for all of our techniques (i.e. DA codes, continuation codes, etc).

Then all of our separate projects that may use it can be created as "branches"
off of the master, that are named. This will allow us to have codes with the
same base (say, for the DA codes), but modify them to satisfy the requirements
of the specific problem.
